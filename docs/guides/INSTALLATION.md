# Installation

$\pi$-PIC has been tested and confirmed to work Linux / macOS / Windows under [`WSL`](learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about). Installation requirements are:
- Python 3
- [`gcc`](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [`fftw3`](http://www.fftw.org/) (`gcc` and `fftw3` must be both of 64-bit format)
- [`openmp`](https://www.openmp.org/)
- [`pybind11`](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) (handled automatically when installed through `pip`)

Furthermore, the following python packages are generally needed for running the code:
- [`numba`](https://numba.pydata.org/)
- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/)

## PyPI
$\pi$-PIC is available through PyPI, which is the recommended installation method:
```
pip install pipic
```
If using a non-standard compiler (for example using `gcc` installed through [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/) on macOS) this can be specified as:
```
CC=<c-compiler> CXX=<c++-compiler> pip install pipic
```
## Compiling latest or specific version from GitHub

1. Create a local folder:
	`mkdir <name>`
	`cd <name>`
2. Clone the project from there and cd to a folder named `pipic`:
	`git clone https://github.com/hi-chi/pipic.git`
	`cd pipic`
3. (optional) Switch to a needed branch:
	`git checkout <name>`
4. (optional) Uninstall previous version of pipic:
	`pip uninstall pipic`
5. Install pipic (you might need to use python instead of python3):
	`python3 -m pip install .`
6. (optional) Check that it works:
    `python3 examples/basic_example.py`

<!---
## CMake
As an alternative, manual compilation is also available using `cmake`. This extends the above requirements to also include:
- [`CMake`](https://cmake.org/) 3.1 or higher

To compile:
- Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/hi-chi/pipic.git
    ```
- Go to `src` folder and fetch `pybind11`:
    ```
    cd pipic/src
    git clone https://github.com/pybind/pybind11
    ```
- Generate binary .so-file by running sequentially:
    ```
    cmake .
    make
    ```
- To use compilers other than default, set the `CC` and `CXX` environment variables prior to running `cmake`, or pass the compilers as arguments to `cmake` using the `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=` and `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=` flags.

To use $\pi$-PIC requires that both the `pipic/` subfolder (python package) and the `_pipic.*.so` binary (C/C++ package) are present in your project folder or otherwise made available, e.g. through your `$PATH`.
